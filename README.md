📚 Book Library Application – ALX Capstone Project
This repository contains my ALX Capstone Project, a comprehensive Book Library Application built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases the knowledge and practical skills I’ve acquired over four months in the ALX Front-End Engineering Program.

🚀 Features
🔍 Book Search & Display
Fetches book data from a public API ( Open Library API) and displays search results in a responsive, user-friendly interface.

📖 Book Detail Page
View detailed information about each book, including title, author, description, cover image, and publish year.

🛠️ Borrow Book Functionality
Users can simulate borrowing a book. Borrowed books are stored locally with a status update.

⭐ Add to Favorites
Users can mark books as favorites and revisit them later via the favorites list.

📚 Add to Reading List
Save books to a personalized reading list for future reference.

🔄 Update Reading Status
Track your reading progress by updating statuses such as Want to Read, Currently Reading, and Finished Reading.

🧭 React Router Integration
Smooth client-side navigation between different pages such as Home, Details, Favorites, Reading List, and Borrowed.

📱 Responsive Design
Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and fully responsive layout across devices.

🏠 Welcome Page
A beautifully designed landing page with an engaging slogan, a "Get Started" button, and attractive visuals.

🛠️ Local Storage
Uses LocalStorage to persist user data (borrowed books, favorites, reading list) across sessions.
✅ Form Handling & Validation
User registration and login forms are handled using Formik with built-in validation (e.g., password length, matching passwords).

📌 Skills Demonstrated: Proficiency in React, including component-based architecture, hooks, props, and state management. Building and styling responsive interfaces using Tailwind CSS. Integration of external APIs and handling asynchronous operations. Routing and navigation with React Router. Version control with Git and collaboration on GitHub. Deployment of React applications on Vercel. This project reflects my progress, dedication, and growing expertise in modern front-end development.
